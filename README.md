# Description
** This uses Open cv to detect the live feed and uses mediapipe to process the feed extract all the necessary information
** This code was originally meant to be a face detection lock so it has a comparing system to recognise , but this can be tweaked to make it a recognition algorithm
** It uses DeepFace from the Tensor Flow library to detect emotions of the face detected in the real time on the camera feed

#### Note 
use python version 3.10.16 for it to work because mediapipe does not work in version of 3.13
